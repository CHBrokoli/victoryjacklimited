This initiative focuses on identifying and addressing the unique financial needs of these regions, leveraging innovative solutions and partnerships to close the gap between supply and demand and fostering sustainable economic growth and development.

## Request

Complete your application by providing personal and income information about yourself and the purpose of the loan. We ask your permission to interrogate the databases to find out your credit history. Based on all this information you will know immediately if you have the loan and under what conditions. Your loan is ready for you and reserved, made up of the best international providers currently available.

If you inform us of the positive result of the controls, you will immediately receive an appointment directly with the service provider where they will explain the conditions of the contract in detail without obligation. Lenders must be sure that their money will end up in serious and reliable hands and that is why there are mandatory conditions to obtain a loan.

- A bank account
- A verifiable income

## You must not have:

- Previous serious insolvency
- High levels of debt
- Insufficient income to cover the fee
- You must be of legal age to obtain a loan
